## Overview
Interdimensional Bonks is an enhanced version of the original InfiniteBonks project, now presented in a Rick and Morty theme. The tool still serves its purpose as a stress testing tool for Darknet sites, but with a fun twist inspired by the popular animated TV show.

## Key Improvements and New Features
1. **Rick and Morty Theme:** The user interface and messages have been revamped with Rick and Morty quotes and colors to create a fun and engaging experience for users.

2. **Improved User Input Handling:** The tool now validates the user input for the URL and the auto-close frequency, providing clear error messages for invalid inputs.

3. **Consent Confirmation:** Before starting the bonks, users are required to read the README and explicitly confirm their agreement to initiate the stress test.

## Usage
1. Enter the portal URL of the target Darknet site in the "Enter Portal URL" input field.
2. Read the README and check the box labeled "I have read the README and Agree to go on an adventure."
3. Optionally, set the "Auto-Close Frequency" to determine how often the tool will auto-close tabs to preserve memory.
4. Click the "Get Schwifty!" button to initiate the bonks. The tool will start opening tabs and automatically close them based on the specified auto-close frequency.

## Security and Legal Considerations
1. **Ethical Use and Informed Consent:** Users must obtain proper authorization before stress testing any site or network. Unauthorized stress testing is illegal and unethical.

2. **Risk of Network Disruption:** Stress testing, especially on Darknet sites or the TOR network, may disrupt services for other users. Exercise caution and respect the network's capacity.

3. **Responsibility and Liability:** The author and contributors are not responsible for any misuse or illegal activities performed using this tool. Use it responsibly and for research purposes only.
